            <h3>Strongest Sorcerer</h3>
            <p> Satoru Gojo is the major character of the popular 2018 dark fantasy anime and manga series, Jujutsu
                Kaisen.
                He is the strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer in the world, even rivalling and surpassing the King of Curses
                Sukuna
                himself.
                Like most sorcerers, Satoru strived to protect the world from the Cursed Spirits that plagued it.
                However,
                Gojo saw the structure of Jujutsu Sorcerer society as flawed, and as such hoped to change it for the
                better.
                To this end, he became a teacher at Jujutsu High, a school dedicated to the cultivation of new
                generations
                of Jujutsu Sorcerers. </p>

            <h2>Strongest sorcerers of the school</h2>
            <p>Back when Satoru was a student, he was extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful
                sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible, his opinion of others often only going as far as his
                judgement of their strength, and he was quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally,
                greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he was very arrogant, convinced that he is the strongest
                in the world,</p>

                <p>The Six Eyes were always bound to Master Tengen and the Star Plasma Vessel by fate. At so9me point in
                    the
                    past, Kenjaku was defeated by two different users of the Six Eyes. After his second defeat, Kenjaku
                    didn't take any chances and killed another Six Eyes user a month after they were born</p>

                <p id="text1">he mental prowess of the Six Eyes can turn one moment in reality into well over a minute's
                    worth of
                    time
                    within the user's brain.[7] This works well in tandem with the users enhanced sight, allowing them
                    to
                    analyze and calculate the positions of everything within view instantly. A sorcerer who possesses
                    the
                    Six Eyes can see things for several kilometers away, easily able to distinctly tell apart different
                    figures within their vast range.</p>
