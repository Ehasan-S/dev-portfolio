            <h3>Strongest Sorcerer</h3>
            <p> Satoru Gojo is the major character of the popular 2018 dark fantasy anime and manga series, Jujutsu
                Kaisen.
                He is the strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer in the world, even rivalling and surpassing the King of Curses
                Sukuna
                himself.
                Like most sorcerers, Satoru strived to protect the world from the Cursed Spirits that plagued it.
                However,
                Gojo saw the structure of Jujutsu Sorcerer society as flawed, and as such hoped to change it for the
                better.
                To this end, he became a teacher at Jujutsu High, a school dedicated to the cultivation of new
                generations
                of Jujutsu Sorcerers. </p>

            <h2>Strongest sorcerers of the school</h2>
            <p>Back when Satoru was a student, he was extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful
                sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible, his opinion of others often only going as far as his
                judgement of their strength, and he was quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally,
                greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he was very arrogant, convinced that he is the strongest
                in the world,</p>
